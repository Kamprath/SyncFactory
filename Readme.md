# SyncFactory

Keeps Satisfactory save files in sync across players' computers using an SFTP server.

## Why?

The Satisfactory dedicated server is buggy (random character resets for example) and may not be ideal for certain players. 

This utility offers an alternative for players who wish to simply sync one save file across their computers.

## Requirements

Requires an SFTP server to be set up with a `/saves` directory. The server must support SSH key authentication.

## Setup

Coming soon.
